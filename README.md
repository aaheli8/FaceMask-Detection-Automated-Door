# FaceMask-Detection-Automated-Door :mask:
Face Mask detection based automated door built with `Python` and `Arduino`.

## Background
The basic idea developed when I started to learn about Arduino and wanted to create a project for social good. We all know it becomes very difficult to check whether a person is wearing a mask or not especially in crowded places. This is a prototype idea for a gate which can be installed at places like school, colleges, hospitals where it is not always possible to check manually whether a person is wearing a mask or not. Wearing mask has played an integral part in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is our responsibility to keep ourselves and others safe.

## About
This project is a Face-Mask-Detection based Gate which built with Python and Arduino UNO. The camera will check whether the person is wearing a face mask or not and based on that the gate will open otherwise not.

## Description
The project has been made with the help of Python using `OpenCV` library.For machine learning part for the face mask recognition has been trained and built using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.The gate part was built with the help of  `Arduino UNO` and `Servo Motors`.
> Basic Working</br>
gate=0;</br>
// This part will be done using Python</br>
 if( person wears face mask ==true)</br>
    Return gate 1</br>
Else </br>
     Return gate 0</br>

>// This part using Arduino, now the output value of the variable gate will be used for automating the gate.</br>

>if( gate == 1)</br>
> Return Opens Gate</br>
>Else</br>
> Return Gate not opened</br>

## Uses
This project can be conveniently used at any  place where there is a high chance of gatherings especially in school, universitties and hospitals.
